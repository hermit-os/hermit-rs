# RustyHermit - A Rust-based, lightweight unikernel

[![Slack Status](https://matrix.osbyexample.com:3008/badge.svg)](https://matrix.osbyexample.com:3008)

[RustyHermit](http://www.hermitcore.org) is a [unikernel](http://unikernel.org) targeting a scalable and predictable runtime for high-performance and cloud computing.
Unikernel means, you bundle your application directly with the kernel library, so that it can run without any installed operating system.
This reduces overhead, therefore, interesting applications include virtual machines and high-performance computing.

The kernel is able to run [Rust](https://github.com/hermitcore/rusty-hermit) applications, as well as [C/C++/Go/Fortran](https://github.com/hermitcore/hermit-playground) applications.

The repository contains following directories and submodules:

1. _demo_ is a small demo application based on the data-parallelism library [Rayon](https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon)
2. _hermit-abi_ contains the platform APIs and builds the interface between library operating system and the application
3. _hermit-sys_ contains a crate to automate the build process of the library operating systems
4. _libhermit-rs_ is the kernel itself
5. _loader_ contains a loader to run RustyHermit on a common virtualization platforms ([Qemu](https://www.qemu.org)) or bare-metal on a x86 system
6. _netbench_ provides some basic network benchmarks

## Background

**RustyHermit** is a rewrite of HermitCore in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) developed at [RWTH-Aachen](https://www.rwth-aachen.de).
HermitCore was a research unikernel written in C ([libhermit](https://github.com/hermitcore/libhermit)).

The ownership  model of Rust guarantees memory/thread-safety and enables us to eliminate many classes of bugs at compile-time.
Consequently, the use of Rust for kernel development promises less vulnerabilities in comparison to common programming languages.

The kernel and the integration into the Rust runtime are entirely written in Rust and do not use any C/C++ Code.
We extended the Rust toolchain so that the build process is similar to Rust's usual workflow.
Rust applications that use the Rust runtime and do not directly use OS services are able to run on RustyHermit without modifications.

## Prerequisites

The Rust toolchain can be installed from the [official webpage](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
RustyHermit currently requires the **nightly versions** of the toolchain.

```sh
rustup default nightly
```

Further requirements are the source code of the Rust runtime,  [cargo-download](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-download), and llvm-tools:

```sh
cargo install cargo-download
cargo install cargo-binutils
rustup component add rust-src
rustup component add llvm-tools-preview
```

## Building your own applications

To give you an example on how to build your application with RustyHermit, lets create a new cargo project:
A more comprehensive version of the example project is published at [rusty-demo](https://github.com/hermitcore/rusty-demo).

```sh
cargo new hello_world
cd hello_world
```

To bind the library operating system to the application, add the crate [hermit-sys](https://crates.io/crates/hermit-sys) to the dependencies in the file *Cargo.toml*.
It is important to use at least the _optimization level 1_.
Consequently, it is required to **extend** *Cargo.toml* with following lines:

```toml
# Cargo.toml

[target.'cfg(target_os = "hermit")'.dependencies]
hermit-sys = "0.1.*"
```

To link the application with RustyHermit, declare `hermit_sys` an `external crate` in the main file of your application.

```rust
// src/main.rs

#[cfg(target_os = "hermit")]
extern crate hermit_sys;

fn main() {
        println!("Hello World!");
}
```

The final step is building the application as follows:

```sh
cargo build -Z build-std=std,core,alloc,panic_abort -Z build-std-features=compiler-builtins-mem --target x86_64-unknown-hermit
```

(You can set an easy alias for this in the `.cargo/config` file. Take a look at the [demo](https://github.com/hermitcore/rusty-demo/blob/master/.cargo/config))

The resulting "hypervisor-ready" binary then can be found in `target/x86_64-unknown-hermit/debug`.

## Running RustyHermit

RustyHermit binaries can be run on either uhyve or qemu.

### Using uhyve as Hypervisor

RustyHermit can run within our own hypervisor [*uhyve*](https://github.com/hermitcore/uhyve) , which requires [KVM](https://www.linux-kvm.org/) to create a virtual machine.
Please install the hypervisor as follows:

```sh
cargo +nightly install uhyve --locked
```

Afterwards, your are able to start RustyHermit applications within our hypervisor:

```sh
uhyve target/x86_64-unknown-hermit/debug/hello_world
```

More details can be found in the [uhyve README](https://github.com/hermitcore/uhyve).

### Using Qemu as Hypervisor

It is also possible to run RustyHermit within [Qemu](https://www.qemu.org).
RustyHermit produces 64-bit binaries, but Qemu's x86 emulation cannot boot them directly.
Therefore, the loader [rusty-loader](https://github.com/hermitcore/rusty-loader) is required to boot the application.
To build the loader, the assembler [nasm](https://www.nasm.us) is required.
After the installation, the loader can be built as follows.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hermitcore/rusty-loader.git
cd rusty-loader
make
```

Afterwards, the loader is stored in `target/x86_64-unknown-hermit-loader/debug/` as `rusty-loader`.
As final step, the unikernel application `app` can be booted with following command:

```bash
qemu-system-x86_64 -display none -smp 1 -m 64M -serial stdio  -kernel path_to_loader/rusty-loader -initrd path_to_app/app -cpu qemu64,apic,fsgsbase,rdtscp,xsave,xsaveopt,fxsr
```

It is important to enable the processor features _fsgsbase_ and _rdtscp_ because it is a prerequisite to boot RustyHermit.

You can provide arguments to the application via the kernel commandline, which you can set with qemu's `-append` option. Since both the kernel and the application can have parameters, they are separated with `--`:

```bash
qemu-system-x86_64 ... -append "kernel-arguments -- application-arguments"
```

### Using Qemu as microVM

Qemu provides [microvm virtual platform](https://qemu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/system/i386/microvm.html), which is a minimalist machine type without PCI nor ACPI support.
In comparison to a common hypervisor, it has a clearly smaller memory footprint and a faster boot time.
To use this VM type, all default features of RustyHermit has to be disabled (especially PCI and ACPI support).
For instance, the following command builds the smallest version of the [`hello_world` example](https://github.com/hermitcore/rusty-hermit/tree/master/examples/hello_world):

```bash
cargo build --no-default-features -p hello_world --release
```

Afterwards, this minimal example can be loaded with the same boot loader like the common Qemu machine type:

```bash
qemu-system-x86_64 \
    -M microvm,x-option-roms=off,pit=off,pic=off,rtc=on,auto-kernel-cmdline=off \
    -nodefaults -no-user-config -display none -smp 1 -m 512M -serial stdio \
    -kernel path_to_loader/rusty-loader \
    -initrd path_to_hello_world/hello_world \
    -cpu qemu64,apic,fsgsbase,rdtscp,xsave,xsaveopt,fxsr \
    -device isa-debug-exit,iobase=0xf4,iosize=0x04 \
    -append "-freq 2800"
```

Depending on the virtualized processor, the processor frequency has to pass as kernel argument (`-freq`) to the kernel.
MHz is used as unit of frequency here.

Kernel features like TCP/IP support can be reenabled manually.
For instance, the following command creates a [minimal web-server](https://github.com/hermitcore/rusty-hermit/tree/master/examples/httpd) for Qemu's microvm platform:

```bash
cargo build --no-default-features --features smoltcp -p httpd --release
```

## Advanced Features

You are not happy with `Hello World` yet?

### Controlling kernel message verbosity

RustyHermit uses the lightweight logging crate [log](https://github.com/rust-lang/log) to print kernel messages.
If the environment variable `HERMIT_LOG_LEVEL_FILTER` is set at compile time to a string matching the name of a [LevelFilter](https://docs.rs/log/0.4.8/log/enum.LevelFilter.html), then that value is used for the LevelFilter.
If the environment variable is not set, or the name doesn't match, then LevelFilter::Info is used by default, which is the same as it was before.

For instance, the following command builds RustyHermit with debug messages:

```sh
HERMIT_LOG_LEVEL_FILTER=Debug cargo build -Z build-std=std,core,alloc,panic_abort --target x86_64-unknown-hermit
```

### Network support

To enable an ethernet device, we have to setup a tap device on the
host system. For instance, the following command establish the tap device
`tap10` on Linux:

```bash
sudo ip tuntap add tap10 mode tap
sudo ip addr add 10.0.5.1/24 broadcast 10.0.5.255 dev tap10
sudo ip link set dev tap10 up
sudo bash -c 'echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/tap10/proxy_arp'
```

Add the feature `smoltcp` in the `Cargo.toml`. This includes the network stack [smoltcp](https://github.com/smoltcp-rs/smoltcp) and offers TCP/UDP communication.
`hermi-sys` dependency has to be factored out of `[target.'cfg(target_os = "hermit")'.dependencies]` because it requires features selection for network support to work thus this snippet should be added to `Cargo.toml` 
```toml
# Cargo.toml

[target.'cfg(target_os = "hermit")'.dependencies.hermit-sys]
version = "0.1.*"
default-features = false
features = ["smoltcp"]
```

Per default, RustyHermit's network interface uses `10.0.5.3` as IP address, `10.0.5.1`
for the gateway and `255.255.255.0` as network mask.
The default configuration could be overloaded at compile time by the environment variables
`HERMIT_IP`, `HERMIT_GATEWAY` and `HERMIT_MASK`.
For instance, the following command sets the IP address to `10.0.5.100`.

```sh
HERMIT_IP="10.0.5.100" cargo build -Z build-std=std,core,alloc,panic_abort --target x86_64-unknown-hermit
```

Currently, RustyHermit does only support network interfaces through [virtio](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/introduction-virtio-networking-and-vhost-net).
To use it, you have to start RustyHermit in Qemu with following command:

```bash
$ qemu-system-x86_64 -cpu qemu64,apic,fsgsbase,rdtscp,xsave,xsaveopt,fxsr \
        -enable-kvm -display none -smp 1 -m 1G -serial stdio \
        -kernel path_to_loader/rusty-loader \
        -initrd path_to_app/app \
        -netdev tap,id=net0,ifname=tap10,script=no,downscript=no,vhost=on \
        -device virtio-net-pci,netdev=net0,disable-legacy=on
```

You can now access the files in SHARED_DIRECTORY under the virtiofs tag like `/myfs/testfile`.
